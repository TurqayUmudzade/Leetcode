Hi recently had phone screen with Amazon after 35 mins of LP was asked below question

Given 'budget' and prices for each category of ads (mxn int array), pick one price from each category and maximize the budget utilization

budget = 30
adPrices=
[3,1,5,7,10]
[7,9,2,20,10]
[3,1,9,45,51]

ans = 30 (take 7 from first, 20 from second and 3 from third category) thanks @lakh for correction

I came up with a greedy approach by sorting each array and then using heap to move my indices starting with lowest in each category, but this didn't work for some cases - O (mn Max(log m, log n)). Brute force is n^m, any ideas?

Company : Amazon
Role : SDE I
Location : Europe
Stage : Phone screen (4/5)
Duree : 1h

Me:
Experience : 0 only internship
Diploma : Master
Leetcode easy : 41
Leetcode medium : 51
Leetcode hard : 3
I took Leetcode premium and assements were very pleasent and usefull

Behavioural:

Tell me about a time you didn't know what to do next in your project, and how did you handle that
Tell me about a time you had deep dive into something new, and what was the outcome
Technical:

What is java Spring, what are the benefits, why for each benefit
How did you use it, why. What would you tell me to convince me that Java Spring is a good fit for this project
Problem-solving:

https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/ (didn't need to code it)
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ (Something similar)
Why this is not always o(n) time complexity (response: hashmap collision)
How do you handle hashmap collision
How would you code a hashmap
Kind of Fibonacci, asked to not code with memorisation
Time complexity (2^n)
Space complexity (2^n) because of the recursive stack
Why use memorisation
time & space complexity with memorisation
Had time to ask 2 questions

My feeling:

Behavioral did ok
Technical did ok but not enough
Problem solving
Great
Ok but had a problem understanding the question, and didn't have answer for not o(n) and collision
Ok but had a problem with time complexity without memorization, I will know now
Guess it will be a failure but it was a great experience and important for the future.
